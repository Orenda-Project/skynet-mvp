# docker-compose.yml
#
# NOTE: This project now uses Supabase for PostgreSQL hosting.
# Local Docker containers are no longer required for database services.
#
# Supabase provides:
# - Managed PostgreSQL database
# - Built-in authentication & authorization
# - Real-time subscriptions
# - Auto-generated REST API
# - File storage
# - pgvector for semantic search
#
# For local development, simply configure your .env file with Supabase credentials.
# No need to run `docker-compose up` anymore!
#
# If you need to run other services locally (Redis, etc.) in the future,
# you can add them here.

version: '3.8'

services:
  # Future services can be added here as needed
  # Example:
  # redis:
  #   image: redis:7-alpine
  #   container_name: skynet-redis
  #   ports:
  #     - "6379:6379"
  #   volumes:
  #     - redis_data:/data

# volumes:
  # redis_data:
  #   driver: local


# ============================================================================
# LEGACY CONFIGURATION (Archived - Using Supabase now)
# ============================================================================
#
# Previously, this file contained PostgreSQL and Neo4j services.
# These have been replaced by Supabase for:
# - Reduced operational complexity
# - Better development experience
# - Managed backups and scaling
# - Built-in features (auth, storage, realtime)
#
# If you need to restore local databases for testing, see git history.
# ============================================================================
